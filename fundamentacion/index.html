<p>The Foundations component of the program is, for the most part, pretty straight forward.
Its subjects are detailed in the Article 2, Item A of the <a href="http://www.legal.unal.edu.co/rlunal/home/doc.jsp?d_i=73711">Curriculum</a>.</p>
<p>In both the Maths and Probability and Statistics groupings there are only optional credits,
with each subgrouping having a choice of a course from either the Engineering or Science Faculties.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the overview, the default choice is the Engineering subject, which most would
call a less rigorous course than the one Science's students take.
Differential, Integral and Multivariate Calculus, Lineal Algebra,
and the Introductory Probability and Statistics are the subjects of these subgroupings,
each with a closely related, advanced counterpart.</p>
<p>The Physics subgrouping has only two subjects, Classical Mechanics and Classical Electromagnetism,
both being tried and true courses, with lectures and lab sessions alike.
As for the subjects on Economics, the Engineering Economics and Project Management classes are optional,
and their counterparts are found in the Faculty of Economic Sciences. These two courses
offer plenty of seats each semester so choosing the alternative outside the Faculty would be uncommon.</p>
<p>All of the subjects mentioned as optional
share all of the prerequisites of their counterparts, so it would be possible to jump back
and forth between the <em>standard</em> path and the <em>option</em>. However, the percieved difficulty of the subjects,
specially those from the Faculty of Science, tilt the students' preference toward the default courses.</p>
<p>Leaving out the Computer Sciences subgrouping, these subjects are found across most,
if not all, degrees of the Faculty of Engineering. On the contrary, several of the subjects from
the <em>Professional</em> component are required in other curriculums.
A more interesting take on this <em>Foundations</em>
component would be a truly common ground between all of the Engineering degrees,
in order to give students the choice of a 'major' after some progress, instead of
leaving them restricted by their initial degree choices.</p>
<p>The Computer Sciences subgrouping stands out with subjects exclusive to the 
Systems and Computing degree, and now partially shared with the recently created 
Computer Science program, although, without any proper relationship between the
subjects from the two faculties.</p>
<p>To start off, both obligatory subjects from this grouping are also obligatory
in the Computer Science program, Algorithms and Introduction to the Theory of Computing,
but with different prerequisites on each program. As for the optative subjects,
its even worse: Discrete Mathematics I and II, and Numerical Methods, have a
counterpart which is obligatory on the Computer Science program, however, these
alternatives and their prerequisites follow the different paths in the two degrees,
which again, reinforces the default Engineering choices, and introduces
unnecessary obstacles on a student who whishes to course them or pursue the two degrees.</p>
