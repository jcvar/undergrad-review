This website contains a personal review on the undergraduate program of
'Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación' at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia,
as coursed from 2016 to 2021.

## Motivation
Most of the student authored reviews and advice found online pertains to the
teachers in charge of a specific subject, and whether to choose them or not over
their colleagues. These may focus on the teachers' knowledge
of the subject, the class' grading methodology or simply their overall attitude,
while discussion over the subject's content is non existent.

The nature of our career demands a constant update on most technical matters which,
in the education space, are seen as mere tools to drive the theorical learning.
The main goal of this effort is to review each of the program's subjects and its
overall (percieved) cohesiveness, along with highlighting the outdated priorities
that may not remain as relevant as they were on the last revision of the program.

Last but not least, everything in this review is highly subjective and I am not an
expert in pedagogy or education.
Inspired by the product review genre and
['My CS degree in # minutes'](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my+cs+degree) videos,
this is the advice I would've liked to have received when I was finishing high school and
I would be more than glad if this can be of use to someone in the same place I was years ago.
Any degree is an enormous investment and a decision on the matter can be overwhelming.

## Roadmap
Working towards a first release, the priority is to build an informative overview
of the whole curriculum, its design as published in the universities' legal documents,
and a visualization of the required courses for graduation.

Over time, detailing of each of the subjects must be added, along with their corresponding
criticism and possible improvements. There must be special care to those early semester
subjects, also required in other degrees of the engineering faculty to which this program
belongs.

A comparison with the 'Ciencias de la Computación' degree, which is still being
consolidated, would be an important future section of this project.

## Contributing
If you're a fellow student or teacher of this program, faculty or university,
I encourage you to share your thoughts on any topic covered or missing in this site.

I hope you found any part of this review useful and worth discussing.
