The official overview of this program can be found [here][link-es] (also in [English][link-en]).

*Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación* is a degree with 165 required credits.
This total is divided into three categories, or components:
- *Fundamentación*
- *Formación Disciplinar o Profesional*
- *Libre Elección*

*Libre Elección* or Free Choice credits are as such, free for the student to
fulfill with any of the classes offered by the faculty, campus wide lectures or
even industry internships. [This is a huge topic that could be further expanded later]

Credits from the first two components are divided into groupings, each with subgroupings
from of a specific knowledge area. Within each subgrouping, there are
obligatory (*Obligatorios*) and optional (*Optativos*) credit requirements.
Most commonly, optional credits can be completed with a choice of two subjects,
and the student is free to take whichever they prefer.

All of the optative credits from both components have a course from the
Faculty of Engineering, or the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department,
as its default offering, and an 'option' from another Department or Faculty.
This set of default options constitute the ['Standard Curriculum'][standard] and is what most
colleagues use as a guide of completion status of the degree.

As ideal as it sounds, most of the optional subjects listed in the legal documents
that define this undergraduate program are off limits for students because of the
prerequisites this 'optional' subjects demand, the priority students from other
Departments have on them, the logistical nightmare that is enrolling on a subject
outside the Department, or perhaps because that 'optional' subject only exists
in paper and isn't offered anymore.

This degree also presents several 'Curricular Path Options', with subjects from
other Departments across campus. Given the issues outlined above, I can bet on the
difficulty of properly completing any of them.
I am yet to meet a colleague who has followed any of these curricular paths,
and I'd be very interested in hearing their experiences.
