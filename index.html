These two courses\noffer plenty of seats each semester so choosing the alternative outside the Faculty would be uncommon.</p>\n<p>All of the subjects mentioned as optional\nshare all of the prerequisites of their counterparts, so it would be possible to jump back\nand forth between the <em>standard</em> path and the <em>option</em>. However, the percieved difficulty of the subjects,\nspecially those from the Faculty of Science, tilt the students' preference toward the default courses.</p>\n<p>Leaving out the Computer Sciences subgrouping, these subjects are found across most,\nif not all, degrees of the Faculty of Engineering. On the contrary, several of the subjects from\nthe <em>Professional</em> component are required in other curriculums.\nA more interesting take on this <em>Foundations</em>\ncomponent would be a truly common ground between all of the Engineering degrees,\nin order to give students the choice of a 'major' after some progress, instead of\nleaving them restricted by their initial degree choices.</p>\n<p>The Computer Sciences subgrouping stands out with subjects exclusive to the \nSystems and Computing degree, and now partially shared with the recently created \nComputer Science program, although, without any proper relationship between the\nsubjects from the two faculties.</p>\n<p>To start off, both obligatory subjects from this grouping are also obligatory\nin the Computer Science program, Algorithms and Introduction to the Theory of Computing,\nbut with different prerequisites on each program. As for the optative subjects,\nits even worse: Discrete Mathematics I and II, and Numerical Methods, have a\ncounterpart which is obligatory on the Computer Science program, however, these\nalternatives and their prerequisites follow the different paths in the two degrees,\nwhich again, reinforces the default Engineering choices, and introduces\nunnecessary obstacles on a student who whishes to course them or pursue the two degrees.</p>\n",

These may focus on the teachers' knowledge\nof the subject, the class' grading methodology or simply their overall attitude,\nwhile discussion over the subject's content is non existent.</p>\n<p>The nature of our career demands a constant update on most technical matters which,\nin the education space, are seen as mere tools to drive the theorical learning.\nThe main goal of this effort is to review each of the program's subjects and its\noverall (percieved) cohesiveness, along with highlighting the outdated priorities\nthat may not remain as relevant as they were on the last revision of the program.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, everything in this review is highly subjective and I am not an\nexpert in pedagogy or education.\nInspired by the product review genre and\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my+cs+degree\">'My CS degree in # minutes'</a> videos,\nthis is the advice I would've liked to have received when I was finishing high school and\nI would be more than glad if this can be of use to someone in the same place I was years ago.\nAny degree is an enormous investment and a decision on the matter can be overwhelming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>Working towards a first release, the priority is to build an informative overview\nof the whole curriculum, its design as published in the universities' legal documents,\nand a visualization of the required courses for graduation.</p>\n<p>Over time, detailing of each of the subjects must be added, along with their corresponding\ncriticism and possible improvements. There must be special care to those early semester\nsubjects, also required in other degrees of the engineering faculty to which this program\nbelongs.</p>\n<p>A comparison with the 'Ciencias de la Computación' degree, which is still being\nconsolidated, would be an important future section of this project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contributing\">Contributing</h2>\n<p>If you're a fellow student or teacher of this program, faculty or university,\nI encourage you to share your thoughts on any topic covered or missing in this site.</p>\n<p>I hope you found any part of this review useful and worth discussing.</p>\n",

[This is a huge topic that could be further expanded later]</p>\n<p>Credits from the first two components are divided into groupings, each with subgroupings\nfrom of a specific knowledge area. Within each subgrouping, there are\nobligatory (<em>Obligatorios</em>) and optional (<em>Optativos</em>) credit requirements.\nMost commonly, optional credits can be completed with a choice of two subjects,\nand the student is free to take whichever they prefer.</p>\n<p>All of the optative credits from both components have a course from the\nFaculty of Engineering, or the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department,\nas its default offering, and an 'option' from another Department or Faculty.\nThis set of default options constitute the <a href=\"https://ingenieria.bogota.unal.edu.co/images/recursos/pregrado/ingenieriaSistemas/IngSistemasyComputacion2014ESTANDAR.pdf\">'Standard Curriculum'</a> and is what most\ncolleagues use as a guide of completion status of the degree.</p>\n<p>As ideal as it sounds, most of the optional subjects listed in the legal documents\nthat define this undergraduate program are off limits for students because of the\nprerequisites this 'optional' subjects demand, the priority students from other\nDepartments have on them, the logistical nightmare that is enrolling on a subject\noutside the Department, or perhaps because that 'optional' subject only exists\nin paper and isn't offered anymore.</p>\n<p>This degree also presents several 'Curricular Path Options', with subjects from\nother Departments across campus. Given the issues outlined above, I can bet on the\ndifficulty of properly completing any of them.\nI am yet to meet a colleague who has followed any of these curricular paths,\nand I'd be very interested in hearing their experiences.</p>\n",
